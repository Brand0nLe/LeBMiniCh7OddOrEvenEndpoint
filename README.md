Mini Challenge 7 - Odd or Even Endpoint

Web API project that will tell the user whether the number they entered via the URL is odd or even. There is an instructions page when the user starts at the localhost url /MiniCh7 and will help them to continue with the program. There is also an error message if the user enters in anything that is not a number.

# Directions:
1. Open the file in visual studio code.
2. Run the debug either by clicking on the "run and debug" icon on the left side and then the green play button, or by using the F5 command.
3. Next you want to go to your debug console located on the bottom by your terminal.
4. Then look for the "Now listening on:" and there should be a local host URL that you can copy.
5. Take that URL and you can either paste it into a web browser, or by using an application called Postman, you can hit the plus sign at the top of Postman and paste the URL there.
6. After you paste the localhost URL either into a browser or postman, add /MiniCh7 at the end and press send. For example: https://localhost:7178/MiniCh7 and this will lead you to an instructions page to help guide you through the application! *See end of directions for what the Instructions page will look like.*
7. At this point you're almost done! Just add a /OddOrEven/yourNumberHere (but with your preferred number of course) at the end of the URL and press send! For example my URL would look like this: https://localhost:7178/MiniCh7/OddOrEven/11
8. If you're having trouble don't forget to check your local host to make sure you're using the right number and ensure that you ran the debug before attempting to use the URL in your web browser or Postman.

*Directions step 6 - What the instructions page will look like when you enter https://localhost:7178/MiniCh7 into Postman or a web browser*

Enter in a number after the localhost URL and I'll tell you if it's odd or even!

For example: https://localhost:7178/MiniCh7/OddOrEven/

And then you would add whatever number you want after the OddOrEven/

If you need an example you can copy my link: https://localhost:7178/MiniCh7/OddOrEven/11



# Peer Review: Jovann Contreras
Code looks great and is very understandable it runs good on postman. One thing that I liked was that it saved the url input in postman so it made it easier to be able to add in a number quick.
